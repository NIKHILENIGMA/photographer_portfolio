 * Middleware to handle 404 Not Found errors.

 * that does not exist in the application. It creates a custom
 * `AppError` instance with a 404 status code and a descriptive
 * error message indicating the requested route was not found.
 * The error is then passed to the `ApiError` handler for further
 * processing.
 *
 * @param req - The incoming HTTP request object.
 * @param _ - The outgoing HTTP response object (unused).
 * @param next - The next middleware function in the stack.
